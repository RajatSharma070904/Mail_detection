# Email Detection App

## Overview
The **Email Detection App** is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes the content of an email to determine whether it is **legitimate** or **unwanted** (spam). It offers a simple, user-friendly interface for users to input email text and receive a prediction based on either rule-based logic or a machine-learning model.

## Features
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Interactive Streamlit app for quick email analysis.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Enter email content and get instant results.
- **Custom Logic**: Uses spam detection logic based on keywords or a pre-trained model.
- **Clear Results**: Displays results as either "Legitimate" or "Unwanted."

## How It Works
1. The user enters the content of an email in the provided text box.
2. The app processes the input using a detection algorithm (e.g., keyword-based or custom ML model).
3. The app predicts whether the email is:
   - **Legitimate**: The email does not contain spam-like content.
   - **Unwanted**: The email contains spam-like content or keywords.
